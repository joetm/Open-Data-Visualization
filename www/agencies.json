GCSS-MC is based upon the Marine Corps Logistics Operational Architecture and logistics business process reengineering initiatives. GCSS-MC is part of a joint GCSS effort, managed by the Joint Staff J-4, aimed at improving logistics capability and filling in deficiencies in the accuracy and timeliness of logistics data. GCSS-MC/LCM:  GCSS-MC Logistics Chain Management (LCM) is a program within GCSS-MC. It is comprised of Increments 1, 2, and 3.  GCSS-MC LCM Increment 1 is the first increment of GCSS-MC.  It provides initial capabilities for GCSS-MC.  The system provides Combat Service Support functionality: Supply, Maintenance, Task Organization, and Request Tracking in a shared data environment in support of deployed operations. Specifically the system centralizes logistics information for access by multiple authorized users (closing a significant warfighting gap), complies with the J-4 GCSS Mission Area Interface Control Document that establishes a DoD Family of Systems for logistics information visibility and decision support, and satisfies initial Marine Corps requirements for meeting Combatant Commander 129/57 Data Elements that provide asset visibility data to Combatant and Joint Task Force Commanders.   GCSS-MC/LCM Increment 1:  GCSS-MC LCM Increment 1 is the first increment of GCSS-MC/LCM.  It is a separate acquisition program with its own milestone events.  It is based on the implementation of Oracle e-Business Suite 11i as the core software package.  Increment 1 provides the foundation for all future Marine Corps logistics systems modernization.  Increments 2 and 3 are not reported here because they have not officially been approved through the new Business Case Lifecycle (BCL) process.","start_date":"01/10/2003","completion_date_b1":"30/09/2023","planned_project_completion_date_b2":"01/07/2013","projectedactual_project_completion_date_b2":"11/03/2013","lifecycle_cost_m":"1022","schedule_variance_in_days":"112","schedule_variance":"9.82","cost_variance_m":"9.2","cost_variance_check":"9.2","check":"","cost_variance":"3.3","planned_cost_m":"279","projectedactual_cost_m":"269.8","updated_date":"29/02/2012","updated_time":"1899-12-31T10:06:31Z","unique_project_id":"P0155-101"},{"unique_investment_identifier":"007-000000178","business_case_id":"15","agency_code":"7","agency_name":"Department of Defense","investment_title":"DEFENSE ENTERPRISE ACCOUNTING AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM","project_id":"2576","agency_project_id":"P0178-103","project_name":"Increment 1","project_description":"Full accounting for USTRANSCOM, Material Sealift Command, Surface Deployment and Distribution Command, Air Mobility Command, Air Combat Command, United States Air Forces Europe, Pacific Air Force, Air Force Special Operations Command, Air Education and Training Command, Air Force Reserve Command, Air National Guard, and Air Force Global Strike Command.

VIPS will enable a responsive, flexible and efficient means to qualify Applicants to meet manpower resource requirements for the uniformed Services, Coast Guard, and National Guard routine and contingency operations.  VIPS will be the future accessioning system to be used by the US Military Entrance Processing Command (USMEPCOM) and will replace their legacy system, USMEPCOM Integrated Resource System (USMIRS).  USMEPCOM serves as the single entry point for determining the physical, aptitude, and conduct qualifications of candidates for enlistment.  VIPS will provide the capability to electronically acquire, process, store, secure, and seamlessly share personnel data across the Accessions Community of Interest (ACOI).  When fully implemented, VIPS will reduce the cycle time required to induct enlistees to meet the needs of Homeland Defense, reduce the number of visits to the Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS), reduce manual data entry errors, and reduce attrition through better pre-screening practices.  The implementation of a Modular Open System Architecture (MOSA) approach will enable accession data to be securely available to applicants and ACOI partners such as Recruiting and Training Commands, Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), Military Health System, Human Resource Management (HRM), and Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO).  VIPS will support compliance with Department of Defense (DoD) direction for a net-centric environment and take advantage of automated data capture technology, e.g., medical equipment with the capability to capture and electronically transmit exam results.  The accessioning system of the future will be location independent, virtually paper-free, and automated to assist with bringing the right people at the right time to operational commanders.

JPALS is a Global Positioning System (GPS)-based precision approach and landing system that will replace several aging and obsolete aircraft landing systems with a family of systems that is more affordable and will function in more operational environments, and support all Department of Defense (DoD) Land and Sea Based applications. The National Defense Strategy of the United States of America calls for highly mobile forces that can rapidly respond to crises worldwide. Success in meeting this challenge requires the ability to land aviation assets virtually anywhere, at any time. JPALS will provide this capability by being rapidly deployable, survivable and interoperable among the U.S. Services and with U.S. allies, as well as with civil aircraft and landing facilities. JPALS will eventually support unmanned and highly automated aircraft, and will be able to operate during restricted Emission Control (EMCON) conditions.The approved JPALS Acquisition Strategy has acquisition broken into seven increments, based on technology maturity and Service needs.

The objective of the LMP - Increment 2 is to enhance LMP by implementing and fully integrating the documented and approved Expanded Industrial Base (EIB) requirements. The EIB requirements include Shop Floor Automation (SFA), Item Unique Identification (IUID), Enterprise Equipment Master (EEM), Automated Identification Technology (AIT), and Plant Equipment Maintenance (PM). Over the past five years, the EIB requirements have emerged from the DoD, the Army and the AMC industrial base. Under close examination of the total requirements set and in line with the current LMP solution, it became clear that EIB requirements were very interrelated and needed to be designed and tested together in a comprehensive solution based on the SAP capabilities. Examination of the complexity involved in implementing these requirements independently is neither logical nor supportable within current resource constraints. Accordingly, the Army determined the need to address these requirements by expanding the LMP solution. The solution for these requirements will be designed, built, and tested together and implemented in cohesive packages to the LMP user community that will meet the critical needs of the various stakeholders, enabling the Department to achieve a clean audit while providing interoperable tools for total asset visibility across the Defense Enterprise.  Ultimately, LMP - Increment 2 will enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the currently deployed solution by providing the critical (e.g. must have) SFA requirements integrated with IUID, EEM, AIT, and PM. The enhancements provided by EIB will provide access to real-time supply chain information at all levels of the enterprise down through the shop floor, and will result in manufacturing (MAN) and remanufacturing (REMAN) capabilities that will improve visibility of work-in-process (WIP), quality management, capacity planning, and traceability/genealogy capability; and implementation of electronic work instructions. Implementation of a consolidated approach of these enhancements at the depots and arsenals will help minimize re-work, causative research, material cost escalation and labor costs increases and comply with the DoD IUID implementation directive.","start_date":"15/01/2012","completion_date_b1":"15/10/2015","planned_project_completion_date_b2":"31/12/2012","projectedactual_project_completion_date_b2":"31/12/2012","lifecycle_cost_m":"32.67","schedule_variance_in_days":"0","schedule_variance":"0","cost_variance_m":"0","cost_variance_check":"0","check":"","cost_variance":"0","planned_cost_m":"32.67","projectedactual_cost_m":"32.67","updated_date":"26/07/2012","updated_time":"1899-12-31T11:53:33Z","unique_project_id":"P6298-101"},{"unique_investment_identifier":"007-000006491","business_case_id":"73","agency_code":"7","agency_name":"Department of Defense","investment_title":"GLOBAL COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM -

It has automatic and on-demand position and status reporting for situation awareness.The US Army''s Force Battlefield Command for Brigade and Below (FBCB2) employs EPLRS as the data communication system backbone for the Tactical Internet (TI). SADL, a variant of EPLRS for aircraft, takes advantage of the EPLRS networking and communications services to provide the pilot with situation awareness and combat ID for the TI.The SADL radio is integrated with the aircraft avionics and displays, providing the pilot with real-time visual tactical data exchange with his wingmen, supporting a variety of co-operative engagement tactics. Fighter positions, radar targets, fuel/weapons stores and ground target positions are shared. The fighter-to-fighter SADL network operation is autonomous and does not rely on the ground-based TI, but can join it, when present, to acquire the ground friendly TI position data. The pilot controls the point around which he can see the closest five TI ground positions, providing for fratricide avoidance in CAS missions. Network planning and initialisation is claimed to be simple and can be customised from the cockpit.","start_date":"03/01/2007","completion_date_b1":"30/09/2012","planned_project_completion_date_b2":"","projectedactual_project_completion_date_b2":"","lifecycle_cost_m":"41.615","schedule_variance_in_days":"0","schedule_variance":"0","cost_variance_m":"0","cost_variance_check":"0","check":"","cost_variance":"0","planned_cost_m":"4.5","projectedactual_cost_m":"4.5","updated_date":"26/10/2011","updated_time":"1899-12-31T09:10:50Z","unique_project_id":"P6388-102"},{"unique_investment_identifier":"007-000006388","business_case_id":"75","agency_code":"7","agency_name":"Department of Defense","investment_title":"Tactical Data Link System","project_id":"2706","agency_project_id":"P6388-103","project_name":"Pocket-J","project_description":"The Pocket-Js are ground stations that allow the Continental U.S. NORAD Region, or CONR, and Air Forces Northern''s two Air Defense Sectors to directly communicate over data-links to fighter, command and control, and other data link equipped aircraft.

CAC2S will accomplish the MACCS missions with a suite of operationally scalable modules to support the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF), Joint, and Coalition Forces. CAC2S integrates the functions of aviation command and air control into an interoperable system that will support the core competencies of all Marine Corps warfighting concepts. CAC2S, in conjunction with MACCS organic sensors and weapons systems, supports the tenets of Expedetionary Maneuver Warfare and fosters joint interoperability. CAC2S Increment I will improve current Aviation Command and Control (AC2) systems in the following Marine aviation agencies: Direct Air Support Center (DASC), Tactical Air Command Center (TACC), and Tactical Air Operations Center (TAOC). Future increments encompassing Marine Air Traffic Control Detachment (MATCD), Low Altitude Air Defense Battalion (LAAD BN), Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and airborne node capabilities are anticipated but are not yet baselined.CAC2S Increment I will be accomplished through a two-phased approach.

The MDD also supported the development of acquisition planning documentation with a target to enter the formal acquisition process.    Phase I of the AoA focused on preliminary assessment of nine (9) alternatives; five (5) of the alternatives were considered potentially viable and carried into the AoA Phase II for more detailed analysis. During the second quarter of FY11, TMA was directed to pause the AoA to support the joint program analysis efforts undertaken by the DoD and VA.  On March 17, 2011, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the VA agreed to jointly pursue a common EHR acquisition.  The Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) (a follow on to originally proposed Electronic Health Record Way Ahead) is designed to provide a comprehensive, longitudinal, electronic health record that is available anytime and anywhere for the lifetime of the patient. Since the original Electronic Health Record Way Ahead (EHR WA) has now become a joint DoD/VA program, iEHR has received an Acquistion Decision Memorandum and is now an official DoD program. Rebaseline is to close out EHR WA and insert new projects, activities, and risk for the iEHR.","start_date":"24/05/2010","completion_date_b1":"17/04/2012","planned_project_completion_date_b2":"17/04/2012","projectedactual_project_completion_date_b2":"17/04/2012","lifecycle_cost_m":"21.932","schedule_variance_in_days":"0","schedule_variance":"0","cost_variance_m":"0","cost_variance_check":"0","check":"","cost_variance":"0","planned_cost_m":"21.932","projectedactual_cost_m":"21.932","updated_date":"22/05/2012","updated_time":"1899-12-31T12:30:35Z","unique_project_id":"P4122-101"},{"unique_investment_identifier":"007-000004122","business_case_id":"924","agency_code":"7","agency_name":"Department of Defense","investment_title":"Electronic Health Record Way Ahead","project_id":"2690","agency_project_id":"P4122-102","project_name":"Infrastructure for EHRWA (Initial Support)","project_description":"Engineering planning, design, and implementation for the network layer and computing infrastructure support services (For this first Exhibit 300 (B) this project is being called Initial Support for ease of reference.

Various information systems (IS) such as the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS) rely on digital signatures that are electronically signed and validated using the SHA.  By using a private key that is paired with a public key, both generated using SHA, a file can be electronically signed and the signature verified by a recipient.  SHA is also used to provide assurance that file has not been altered, either intentionally or unintentionally, during transmission.  The current standard for that utility is know as SHA-1.    DoD has mandated that all DoD systems must use a new version fo SHA-2 no later than December 31, 2013.An initial evaluation of the DCPDS system identified several hardware and software items that will be affected by this security posture change.

MA plans are paid approximately $13 billion per month for the more than 11 million Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in MA plans.  Improvements in the accuracy of these payments will have a significant impact on the program. The current risk adjustment model is estimated using Fee-For-Service (FFS) cost and diagnoses data. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has shown that patterns in FFS and MA diagnostic data differ in important ways and lead to overpayments to MA plans. Adding health care encounter data to the existing risk adjustment system will improve the accuracy of the risk adjustment model used to pay MA plans by reflecting the appropriate patterns of utilization and costs within the MA program. While establishing a risk adjustment model more appropriate for MA plans is the paramount reason for collecting MA encounter data, there are other important uses of the data that will improve other key functions undertaken by CMS, including: calculation of Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments, quality review and improvement activities, and Medicare coverage purposes. Thus, there is a need to properly collect, edits, and store the MA health care data necessary to describe and price a health care encounter; this is in addition to the currently collected, edited and stored diagnosis data.  There is also a need to develop the capability to price the MA health care encounter data to be able to estimate the cost of a Medicare beneficiary enrolled in an MA plan. The EDS project will assist CMS in achieving its agency-wide goal of reaching accurate and predictable payments.  Specifically, those paid through the Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug System (MARx). The three main objectives to obtain with the implementation of the EDS project are: Collection and pricing of more than 330 million claims annually supporting 11 million beneficiaries enrolled in the MA program, Obtain reports that reflect true MA beneficiary utilization by 2013, and Providing appropriate data leading to more accurate Risk Adjustment model development by 2015.","start_date":"01/01/2009","completion_date_b1":"01/01/2015","planned_project_completion_date_b2":"","projectedactual_project_completion_date_b2":"","lifecycle_cost_m":"45.43","schedule_variance_in_days":"0","schedule_variance":"0","cost_variance_m":"-46.92","cost_variance_check":"-0.678","check":"46.242","cost_variance":"-1.49","planned_cost_m":"45.43","projectedactual_cost_m":"46.108","updated_date":"23/07/2012","updated_time":"1899-12-31T09:41:12Z","unique_project_id":"285833"},{"unique_investment_identifier":"009-000001465","business_case_id":"274","agency_code":"9","agency_name":"Department of Health and Human Services","investment_title":"CMS Health Care Quality Improvement System (QIES)","project_id":"2022","agency_project_id":"286250","project_name":"QIES CLIA Online Accounting","project_description":"CLIA Online accounting activities.","start_date":"27/07/2011","completion_date_b1":"31/12/2011","planned_project_completion_date_b2":"31/12/2011","projectedactual_project_completion_date_b2":"18/12/2011","lifecycle_cost_m":"1","schedule_variance_in_days":"13","schedule_variance":"8.28","cost_variance_m":"1","cost_variance_check":"0.02","check":"-0.98","cost_variance":"2","planned_cost_m":"1","projectedactual_cost_m":"0.98","updated_date":"26/04/2012","updated_time":"1899-12-31T10:50:53Z","unique_project_id":"286250"},{"unique_investment_identifier":"009-000001465","business_case_id":"274","agency_code":"9","agency_name":"Department of Health and Human Services","investment_title":"CMS Health Care Quality Improvement System (QIES)","project_id":"2023","agency_project_id":"286461","project_name":"QIES ASSURE","project_description":"Centralize and integrate the existing ASSURE system which provides data capture and reporting of accredited or deemed providers managed by Accrediting Organizations into QIES.","start_date":"16/08/2011","completion_date_b1":"31/01/2013","planned_project_completion_date_b2":"","projectedactual_project_completion_date_b2":"","lifecycle_cost_m":"0.65","schedule_variance_in_days":"0","schedule_variance":"0","cost_variance_m":"-15.27","cost_variance_check":"-0.095","check":"15.175","cost_variance":"-14.62","planned_cost_m":"0.65","projectedactual_cost_m":"0.745","updated_date":"26/07/2012","updated_time":"1899-12-31T10:08:04Z","unique_project_id":"286461"},{"unique_investment_identifier":"009-000001465","business_case_id":"274","agency_code":"9","agency_name":"Department of Health and Human Services","investment_title":"CMS Health Care Quality Improvement System (QIES)","project_id":"2024","agency_project_id":"288991","project_name":"QIES CLIA Batch Billing","project_description":"Conversion of the CLIA batch jobs.

This redesign will also close the gap in support of the mission delivery and management support by making extensive changes to the existing MSIS. To satisfy the new requirements, the MSIS will collect and report on 300-500 additional data elements on a projected monthly collection/reporting process. This will require technical assistance for the states to 1) identify state source systems for new data elements, 2) collaborate with the State CHIP Agency for reporting data to MSIS, 3) ensure that Managed Care plans are sending necessary claims data to states, and 4) ensure and map managed care claims into MSIS. Automation tools will be introduced to extract, transform and load (ETL) data and for the Data Quality/Accuracy process and to enhance analytics for MSIS Front-End data collection.

The original goal of MAS was to utilize MAS throughout the five levels of the Medicare appeals process. This would consolidate all levels of appeal in one system, and allow an electronic case file to be used throughout the life of the appeal with a clear audit trail of all actions taken. Since May and September 2005, CMS and OMHA have, respectively, established functionality for level 2 and level 3 appeals tracking in MAS and continually enhance that functionality. However, without the level 1 appeals information in the system, there are still many issues in obtaining and transmitting the correct appeals information throughout the appeals process. The primary purpose of the MAS is to collect and maintain the information necessary to process Medicare claim appeals.  The MAS currently tracks procedural and medical appeals data including, but not limited to, appeal status, appeal timeliness, appeal disposition, claims information, and services at issue.  All of the information captured in the MAS on the workflow processing side (in Siebel) is available in a customized reporting suite (in Cognos) and can be extracted and analyzed.  Given the MAS' capabilities for cross-level case tracking, interfacing with the shared systems, and electronic imaging, we believe that expanding use of the MAS to encompass first level appeals has the potential to create significant efficiencies in the claim appeals process. Thus, CMS is exploring options to implement the MAS at all Durable Medical Equipment MACs (DME MACs) and Part A and Part B MACs (A/B MACs).","start_date":"30/09/2011","completion_date_b1":"29/09/2012","planned_project_completion_date_b2":"","projectedactual_project_completion_date_b2":"","lifecycle_cost_m":"0.42","schedule_variance_in_days":"-92","schedule_variance":"-37.7","cost_variance_m":"0.004","cost_variance_check":"0.004","check":"","cost_variance":"0.95","planned_cost_m":"0.419","projectedactual_cost_m":"0.415","updated_date":"23/07/2012","updated_time":"1899-12-31T09:41:01Z","unique_project_id":"295190"},{"unique_investment_identifier":"009-000005234","business_case_id":"287","agency_code":"9","agency_name":"Department of Health and Human Services","investment_title":"CMS Medicare Integrity Program Modernization-One PI System","project_id":"2035","agency_project_id":"288800","project_name":"SGS Development 2012","project_description":"SGS DME for 2012 consists of:- Access to SAS- Access to NGD/BIU- Shared Systems- ETL & BO Universe - AS development.","start_date":"29/09/2011","completion_date_b1":"31/03/2012","planned_project_completion_date_b2":"","projectedactual_project_completion_date_b2":"","lifecycle_cost_m":"2.02","schedule_variance_in_days":"-153","schedule_variance":"-83.15","cost_variance_m":"-1.01","cost_variance_check":"-1.01","check":"","cost_variance":"-50","planned_cost_m":"2.02","projectedactual_cost_m":"3.03","updated_date":"28/06/2012","updated_time":"1899-12-31T07:59:10Z","unique_project_id":"288800"},{"unique_investment_identifier":"009-000005234","business_case_id":"287","agency_code":"9","agency_name":"Department of Health and Human Services","investment_title":"CMS Medicare Integrity Program Modernization-One PI System","project_id":"2036","agency_project_id":"289416","project_name":"SGS Development 2011","project_description":"DME for 2011 from July forward consists of:- Implementation of List of Values within the BI Portal- Implementation of Universes and Report - BENE address table removal.","start_date":"03/01/2011","completion_date_b1":"31/03/2012","planned_project_completion_date_b2":"21/11/2011","projectedactual_project_completion_date_b2":"09/01/2012","lifecycle_cost_m":"0.6","schedule_variance_in_days":"-49","schedule_variance":"-15.22","cost_variance_m":"-0.009","cost_variance_check":"-0.009","check":"","cost_variance":"-1.5","planned_cost_m":"0.6","projectedactual_cost_m":"0.609","updated_date":"26/04/2012","updated_time":"1899-12-31T10:50:58Z","unique_project_id":"289416"},{"unique_investment_identifier":"009-000005234","business_case_id":"287","agency_code":"9","agency_name":"Department of Health and Human Services","investment_title":"CMS Medicare Integrity Program Modernization-One PI System","project_id":"2037","agency_project_id":"299930","project_name":"2013 DME Activity","project_description":"Continue to add Data, Analytical tools, create virtual views, and usable report structures.","start_date":"01/10/2012","completion_date_b1":"31/12/2013","planned_project_completion_date_b2":"","projectedactual_project_completion_date_b2":"","lifecycle_cost_m":"2.063","schedule_variance_in_days":"0","schedule_variance":"0","cost_variance_m":"0","cost_variance_check":"0","check":"","cost_variance":"0","planned_cost_m":"2.063","projectedactual_cost_m":"2.063","updated_date":"26/04/2012","updated_time":"1899-12-31T10:50:58Z","unique_project_id":"299930"},{"unique_investment_identifier":"009-000005345","business_case_id":"298","agency_code":"9","agency_name":"Department of Health and Human Services","investment_title":"FDA CDER Automated Drug Information Management System","project_id":"2175","agency_project_id":"283741","project_name":"Document Archiving, Reporting & Regulatory Tracking System","project_description":"DARRTS is the principal CDER system that supports the receipt, tracking, management, and reporting of information about clinical investigation and market submissions for human drugs and therapeutics biologics.

MARCS is divided into a set of components. There are application and service components. The work flows in ORA will often cross multiple organizations and include a number of different user activity types such as screening, field exams, sample collections, sample analysis, and compliance. The application components are designed to provide user groups with a one stop shop interface that will allow them to perform work from their user point of view. Functionality is only implemented once in a component. One user group work flow may use functionality from most of the MARCS components. This has implications for the management of MARCS. While the individual projects build out certain types of functionality, these need to be combined and coordinated into a whole in order to provide a useful work flow that covers the whole life cycle of a regulated product as it passes from one user group to the next. This combination and coordination needs to occur at the program level rather than in individual projects. Providing this glue to produce a holistic and comprehensive system is the goal of PMTI. Because of this approach, most of the EPLC stage gates are handled at the release level rather than at the project level. Each MARCS release is composed of functionality produced by one or more projects that has been logically grouped to support work flows. PMTI includes work for MARCS 0.5, 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 releases. Work for a release will begin 6 - 12 months before that release is scheduled. PMTI begins work on a release when it is time to start system integration testing. Work for a release includes system integration testing, promotion to the pre-production environment, performance testing, user acceptance testing, promotion to the production environment, security testing, and then release. Program management in this project includes release management and management of dependencies. This also includes system architecture, a road map, inter project coordination, decision analysis (for technology and platform selection), security work, user experience management (user friendly and consistent interface), inter project requirements management, status meetings, reports, risk management, and configuration management.

EM will provide functionality for screening, in conjunction with PREDICT, for the majority of the 20,000,000+ products imported via the 801(a) process annually. This will give import screeners and import compliance officers a unified interface for dealing with all of their work flows, including tracking Field Work (accomplished in Field Work Manager (FWM)). PREDICT is an expert system built around a rules engine that produces a risk-based score of imported products. Products with a low score are automatically sent forward by PREDICT.

MARCS has a primary focus on integration across the organization and as the BPMS would help further this goal, these licenses have been expanded to enable organization wide integration. IDM will give MARCS a comprehensive COTS solution to provide the specialized functionality and fine grained security control envisioned. This will require some custom code to realize envisioned functionality. The custom code will be developed under Authorization, Roles, and Responsibilities Management Services (ARRMS) 2 - Supplemental. IDM may also be leveraged as an FDA wide solution in the future. The implementation of IDM will be used by every component within MARCS. This has been vetted with the FDA CIO and HHS CIO and conforms to HHS standard security. WebCenter provides robust user interface and portal capabilities. This COTS will be used to implement User Workspace Enhancement Services (UWES), which is part of the Support Services project. UWES will provide a standardized user experience customized based on user role and single user preferences. OPA is a rules engine that will have a number of applications in MARCS ranging from inspection preparation, intelligent questionnaires, and import screening support. RUEI is a tool that can be used from a centralized location to determine the experience that an end user at a remote site is having. ORA is a geographically dispersed organization. In this sense, the user community for MARCS is different from Center user communities since the vast majority of users are not in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. This tool will give ORA and OIM a new ability to understand what is actually happening at user sites and will enable a systematic approach towards improving performance and reliability in the Field. The software acquired will be used in all of the MARCS projects going forward to one degree or another and will enable MARCS functionality that will be realized in releases.","start_date":"04/08/2011","completion_date_b1":"30/09/2011","planned_project_completion_date_b2":"30/09/2011","projectedactual_project_completion_date_b2":"30/09/2011","lifecycle_cost_m":"4.856","schedule_variance_in_days":"0","schedule_variance":"0","cost_variance_m":"0","cost_variance_check":"0","check":"","cost_variance":"0","planned_cost_m":"4.856","projectedactual_cost_m":"4.856","updated_date":"23/02/2012","updated_time":"1899-12-31T12:00:22Z","unique_project_id":"286298"},{"unique_investment_identifier":"009-000005317","business_case_id":"310","agency_code":"9","agency_name":"Department of Health and Human Services","investment_title":"FDA ORA Mission Accomplishments and Regulatory Compliance Services","project_id":"2918","agency_project_id":"306567","project_name":"FDA ORA MARCS Authorization, Roles, and Responsibilities Management Services (ARRMS) 3","project_description":"ARRMS provides all of the security for MARCS.

The DW has information in it that has been transformed into a star schema so that it is a Decision Support System (DSS). In addition, for some user communities, it is much more effective for them to only have to deal with a subset of all of the data in the DW. For such user communities, ORADSS has a number of Data Marts (DM) that certain designated users can use for querying. These are also used to support universes for reporting. ORADSS uses a COTS, Business Objects (BO), as a reporting tool. BO utilizes universes as a meta-data layer that allows for an abstraction of the underlying schema, table names, row names, and data types so that non technical users can access this data more easily. The universe structures may then be used to build reports. End users typically interact with the reports, but there are a number of end users who need to delve more deeply into the data than is allowed by a report.

This includes receiving firm information from registration and listing from the FDA Unified Registration and Listing System (FURLS). FURLS is being partially replaced by eLIST. FMLS will integrate with eLIST (no acronym). The firm data is built around Firm Establishment Identifiers (FEIs). These define a location and a product or a set of products. A large company may have multiple FEIs if it has multiple physical locations and/or produces different products that are regulated by FDA. This information is always changing as firms and market conditions change.  In addition, foreign firms that do not use a Latin alphabet present a particular problem as words can be transliterated into English in different ways. If this is left unchecked, it causes a proliferation of FEIs that are not all that useful in identifying what firm is what. To address this, FMLS employs Dataflux, a COTS, in implementing survivorship rules that are used to clean up this firm data and consolidate and remove FEIs. FMLS is also being integrated with Dunn and Bradstreet (DnB). DnB has one of the largest and most reliable databases on businesses in the world.

In 2006, Executive Order 13410 required healthcare programs administered or sponsored by the Federal government to promote quality and efficient delivery through the use of health information technology. HHS was tasked with developing a program to assist agencies to meet EO 13410 and monitor their progress. Subsequently, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) was established.   The FHA is a partnership among Federal Agencies and the OMB, and managed by ONC with HHS, acting as the Managing Partner, along with the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, acting as Lead Partners, provides funding for the program. These agencies collaborate to advance health information interoperability between Federal Agencies, and between agencies and the tribal, state, local and private sectors.  Through the FHA program, Federal Agencies have joined together to rapidly and efficiently implement government-wide solutions for interoperable and secure health information exchange that address agency business priorities, while protecting citizen privacy. FHA serves the needs of more than 20 Federal Agencies in domains as diverse as military and veterans' healthcare, public health monitoring, long-term care and disability services, research, tribal health services and many other critical Federal priorities.","start_date":"30/04/2004","completion_date_b1":"30/09/2014","planned_project_completion_date_b2":"30/09/2012","projectedactual_project_completion_date_b2":"30/09/2012","lifecycle_cost_m":"65.007","schedule_variance_in_days":"0","schedule_variance":"0","cost_variance_m":"0.165","cost_variance_check":"0.165","check":"","cost_variance":"2.14","planned_cost_m":"7.71","projectedactual_cost_m":"7.545","updated_date":"23/07/2012","updated_time":"1899-12-31T09:40:56Z","unique_project_id":"288883"},{"unique_investment_identifier":"009-000001397","business_case_id":"332","agency_code":"9","agency_name":"Department of Health and Human Services","investment_title":"HHS Unified Financial Management System: Modernization Program","project_id":"2224","agency_project_id":"302739","project_name":"Dashboard and Business Intelligence (Crawl/Walk/Run)","project_description":"The Dashboard and Business Intelligence project addresses the gap identified during the UFMS Deep Dive Assessment to improve reporting and decision support across HHS OpDivs and StaffDivs.  This was a key short-term, high-impact recommendation specified in the UFMS Deep Dive Assessment Final Report; it received the highest priority rating from points of contact for UFMS OpDiv and StaffDiv stakeholders for projects to be pursued.  The scope of this project is to (1) define an HHS-wide reporting strategy, and (2) to implement Oracle's Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition (OBIEE) and address this business need for users of UFMS.  This project heavily leverages work performed by FDA on their OBIEE pilot.  This involved implementation of OBIEE Plus for use by approximately 50 seat licenses; configuration of extract, transform, and load (ETL) routines to load FDA data from UFMS and to address Oracle Descriptive FlexFields (DFFs); and enhancement and development of dashboards and reports to meet FDA specific business needs.  These configurations and enhancements can be adjusted to enable rapid development and delivery of a global UFMS data warehouse for use with OBIEE.  Program data can be integrated either through individual data warehouses for each set of books (SOB), or loaded into the single central warehouse.  While our preliminary analysis indicates a hybrid approach that shares a central financial data warehouse with OpDiv-specific program data warehouses as most likely the best fit architecture for OpDiv business needs, the detailed OBIEE needs assessment work that is being planned by the UFMS Program Management Office (PMO) will determine the specific details of the go-forward solution.  This solution seeks not only to improve reporting and decision support, but also to consolidate the large number of disparate reporting systems used across the Department that provide redundant capabilities today.

The project includes incorporating additional functionality in the system that supports the lifecycle management of budgets - from formulation through execution.  However, as the HHS the Office of is in early planning stages seeking to implement the Departmental e-Budgeting System (DEBS) as a Department-wide budget formulation tool, this effort will focus on the budget planning through budget execution functions with an interface to DEBS and integration with UFMS.  Improvement in this area directly affects audit material weaknesses related to budgetary analysis,[1] such as reducing manual entries and facilitating compliance with the Anti-Deficiency Act (ADA).  This also addresses a common sentiment among the user groups that UFMS is an accounting system rather than a financial management system.The Hyperion Performance-Based Budgeting Solution provides an enterprise-level solution for budget formulation, execution, and distribution, which eliminates the need for multiple spreadsheets, separate feeder applications, and numerous individual processes.  This will allow users to spend less time reconciling data and more time analyzing and planning, provides for more accurate reports to OMB, the ability to monitor and measure agency performance against agency goals, provides security and audit trails, and offers a variety of statements and reports.

CTEP-ESYS collects safety and clinical results data on 1,356 ongoing cancer clinical trials (trials not yet completed); of those 1,116 are treatment trials. CTEP-ESYS tracks more than 27,000 patients per year in more than 24 disease areas. The system supports 517,000 drug orders and 37,000 registered investigators. Data reporting and analysis in real time is critical to ensuring adequate monitoring of the ongoing clinical research. Timely data reporting and analysis also assures effective planning for the required successor studies, thus accelerating the evaluation of promising new agents and regimens for patients with cancer. An effective CTEP-ESYS allows investigators and researchers to focus on scientific opportunity, patient safety and reducing the burden of cancer on the public by finding better ways to treat, control and cure cancer. There are many components that support CTEP needs including protocol tracking, agent authorization and tracking, clinical data reporting, adverse event reporting and processing, clinical trials auditing, financial management, investigational new agent and development, disease management and tracking, annual report generation, regulatory activities, account management, investigator registration, reporting and analysis. CTEP-ESYS consist of a common repository that interfaces with suite of applications that are integrated and support the cancer-clinical trials infrastructure.","start_date":"01/02/2009","completion_date_b1":"31/01/2016","planned_project_completion_date_b2":"","projectedactual_project_completion_date_b2":"","lifecycle_cost_m":"9","schedule_variance_in_days":"0","schedule_variance":"0","cost_variance_m":"0.245","cost_variance_check":"0.245","check":"","cost_variance":"2.72","planned_cost_m":"9","projectedactual_cost_m":"8.755","updated_date":"26/04/2012","updated_time":"1899-12-31T10:50:48Z","unique_project_id":"298092"},{"unique_investment_identifier":"009-000001410","business_case_id":"342","agency_code":"9","agency_name":"Department of Health and Human Services","investment_title":"NIH OD Electronic Research Administration (eRA)","project_id":"2014","agency_project_id":"282597","project_name":"eRA - Electronic Intake of Type 3s and Type 7s","project_description":"Transitioning the Type 3s ( Administrative Supplements) and Type 7s (Change of Institute Request) from a paper submission process to a fully electronic process.","start_date":"09/09/2010","completion_date_b1":"27/07/2012","planned_project_completion_date_b2":"","projectedactual_project_completion_date_b2":"","lifecycle_cost_m":"1.455","schedule_variance_in_days":"-35","schedule_variance":"-5.09","cost_variance_m":"-0.041","cost_variance_check":"-0.041","check":"","cost_variance":"-2.82","planned_cost_m":"1.455","projectedactual_cost_m":"1.496","updated_date":"27/02/2012","updated_time":"1899-12-31T11:32:35Z","unique_project_id":"282597"},{"unique_investment_identifier":"009-000001410","business_case_id":"342","agency_code":"9","agency_name":"Department of Health and Human Services","investment_title":"NIH OD Electronic Research Administration (eRA)","project_id":"2015","agency_project_id":"282741","project_name":"eRA - Accommodate Mandated FCOI Changes","project_description":"The goal of this project is to implement changes to the FCOI module within the commons application, which have been mandated.","start_date":"24/04/2011","completion_date_b1":"27/04/2012","planned_project_completion_date_b2":"27/04/2012","projectedactual_project_completion_date_b2":"27/04/2012","lifecycle_cost_m":"0.35","schedule_variance_in_days":"-126","schedule_variance":"-34.15","cost_variance_m":"0.006","cost_variance_check":"0.006","check":"","cost_variance":"1.71","planned_cost_m":"0.35","projectedactual_cost_m":"0.344","updated_date":"27/02/2012","updated_time":"1899-12-31T11:32:35Z","unique_project_id":"282741"},{"unique_investment_identifier":"009-000001410","business_case_id":"342","agency_code":"9","agency_name":"Department of Health and Human Services","investment_title":"NIH OD Electronic Research Administration (eRA)","project_id":"2016","agency_project_id":"283086","project_name":"eRA - Receipt and Referral Re-Engineering","project_description":"The objective of the R&R Re-Engineering project is to produce a single robust Receipt and Referal system.","start_date":"02/06/2010","completion_date_b1":"26/10/2012","planned_project_completion_date_b2":"","projectedactual_project_completion_date_b2":"","lifecycle_cost_m":"2.674","schedule_variance_in_days":"0","schedule_variance":"0","cost_variance_m":"-0.07","cost_variance_check":"-0.07","check":"","cost_variance":"-2.62","planned_cost_m":"2.674","projectedactual_cost_m":"2.744","updated_date":"27/02/2012","updated_time":"1899-12-31T11:32:35Z","unique_project_id":"283086"},{"unique_investment_identifier":"009-000001410","business_case_id":"342","agency_code":"9","agency_name":"Department of Health and Human Services","investment_title":"NIH OD Electronic Research Administration (eRA)","project_id":"2017","agency_project_id":"283087","project_name":"eRA - Electronic Application Processing Updates","project_description":"The goal of this project is to develop and implement support, within the eSubmission system, for the latest SF424 (R&R) OMB-cleared forms available through Grants.gov.

This investment will enable the development of standards in health information exchange that follow the consumer, be available for critical clinical decision making, and support appropriate use of healthcare information beyond direct patient care so as to improve health outcomes. The investment seeks to achieve these goals by coordinating stakeholders in developing interoperable standards and by engaging industry and federal agencies in developing prototypes and trials. Executive Order 13410 requires Federal Agencies to adopt health IT standards that have been recognized by the HHS Secretary when developing or enhancing health information systems.     Initially established as a program under ONC in 2004, the goals of the program, then called NHIN Exchange were to improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare by establishing a mechanism for nationwide health information exchange. The NwHIN Exchange went through a prototyping and trial implementations phase where an architecture and set of Service Oriented Architecture based specifications were developed to provide a common, secure and trusted network to enable the exchange of health information among private networks and Federal health networks. The effort effectively integrated specifications, implementation guidelines, compliance, interoperability verification, and network operations with a strong trust fabric to allow for interoperable health information exchange.      The NwHIN program has evolved to become much more flexible, to include specifications from not only the NHIN Exchange program, but also use specifications developed from the ONC led Direct project. The NwHIN program is envisaged to include a portfolio of specifications from Exchange, Direct and Blue Button. This broad array of standards will allow stakeholders to exchange health related information using internet, at various levels of complexity of needs. The NwHIN has developed and continues to develop modular specifications, reference implementations and detailed test cases, to guide adoption by the stakeholders. These assets are publically available for download on the HHS website.","start_date":"31/08/2004","completion_date_b1":"30/09/2014","planned_project_completion_date_b2":"","projectedactual_project_completion_date_b2":"","lifecycle_cost_m":"95.907","schedule_variance_in_days":"0","schedule_variance":"0","cost_variance_m":"-0.007","cost_variance_check":"-0.007","check":"","cost_variance":"-0.15","planned_cost_m":"4.82","projectedactual_cost_m":"4.827","updated_date":"29/03/2012","updated_time":"1899-12-31T10:26:33Z","unique_project_id":"288847"},{"unique_investment_identifier":"009-000006779","business_case_id":"354","agency_code":"9","agency_name":"Department of Health and Human Services","investment_title":"Secure One HHS","project_id":"2180","agency_project_id":"289186","project_name":"Trusted Internet Connection (TIC)","project_description":"The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) Project was formed to comply with Office Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum M-08-05, Implementation of Trusted Internet Connections.

The TIC Initiative establishes a basis for consolidated infrastructure to achieve interoperability and communication among operating divisions.  In response to this initiative, HHS will adopt a network and security architecture that complies with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) TIC requirements and reduces the total number of external connections to include Internet, inter-agency, partner, contractor, educational, health and research connectivity.   Once implemented, the TIC environment will improve HHS's incident response capability; reduce the number of external connection points within HHS; and provide centralized monitoring of HHS network security controls.

The number of quality measures to be included for 2012 is not established at this time.  There were 190 quality measures in 2011.  For 2012 there will continue to be multiple reporting options through claims and will continue to include measure groups.  The Physician Quality Reporting System will support multiple submission methods such as Electronic Health Record Registry and Group Practices Reporting Options (GPROs I and II).  It is anticipated that the incentive will be based, as in past years, on the total allowed Medicare Physician Fee Schedule charges for the reporting period.Continuing in 2012, there will be the Electronic Prescribing (eRx) Initiative which is available for those EP's that are considered successful electronic prescribers (eRx-ers) as defined in the CMS eRx specifications.  As in 2011, both individual and selected GPROs may report on the eRx measure through claims, registries or EHR's.  Successful eRx-ers will potentially earn an incentive payment based on their total allowed Medicare Physician Fee Schedule charges for the 12 month reporting period.  Currently successful electronic prescribers will not be eligible to receive an incentive under the eRx Incentive Program if they are also receiving an incentive under the Health Information Technology (HIT) Incentive Program authorized by the Recovery Act, enacted on February 17, 2009. Future rule making may further align the incentives programs. EP's that are not electronic prescribers will receive a penalty adjustment starting in 2012 based on the first 6 months of claims data submitted in 2011.  The eRx Initiative will provide Interim Feedback Reporting to EP's.  Measures and other data sources may be added for the 2012 Program Year to allow EP's options for successfully reporting the eRx measure for both the penalty and incentive programs.  EP's may have the flexibility of expanding and adding additional hardship codes for exemption for all years.","start_date":"10/03/2012","completion_date_b1":"29/09/2013","planned_project_completion_date_b2":"","projectedactual_project_completion_date_b2":"","lifecycle_cost_m":"53.04","schedule_variance_in_days":"0","schedule_variance":"0","cost_variance_m":"0.003","cost_variance_check":"0.003","check":"","cost_variance":"0.01","planned_cost_m":"53.04","projectedactual_cost_m":"53.037","updated_date":"23/07/2012","updated_time":"1899-12-31T09:41:18Z","unique_project_id":"294311"},{"unique_investment_identifier":"009-000281532","business_case_id":"1091","agency_code":"9","agency_name":"Department of Health and Human Services","investment_title":"CMS Quality Program","project_id":"2062","agency_project_id":"294349","project_name":"QPI- Hospital Value Based Purchasing(3001)","project_description":"The Hospital Value Based Purchasing is an upgrade to the Hospital Reporting 1.0 release and will include all services and functions necessary to serve the needs of Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting and Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting.

It will identify cognitive support and display change requirements for early transition to a high altitude specialty and will develop and validate automation changes needed to implement a new high altitude operating concept that will create a more flexible high altitude airspace concept by increasing staffing flexibility, reducing training time, and enabling traffic peaks to be handled by fewer controllers. Initial operational concept development and validation efforts have concluded that in high altitude airspace, the local knowledge information needed is considerably less than in lower altitude airspace and that different operating strategies can be used to more dynamically adjust staffing and airspace to meet demand and reduce operating costs. By providing local knowledge through information accessible through the controller display and other tools, there will be increased flexibility in the assignment of airspace to controllers, increasing overall productivity and flexibility to deal with weather and congestion events. This activity will work to define and develop the information display and decision support tool changes to provide this local knowledge and conduct human-in-the-loop simulations with controllers to assess the effectiveness of the information content and automation and display changes to enable rapid training (in terms of hours) of controllers to safely and efficiently control the airspace.","start_date":"01/10/2010","completion_date_b1":"30/09/2012","planned_project_completion_date_b2":"30/09/2012","projectedactual_project_completion_date_b2":"30/09/2012","lifecycle_cost_m":"2.505128","schedule_variance_in_days":"0","schedule_variance":"0","cost_variance_m":"-0.045369","cost_variance_check":"-0.045369","check":"","cost_variance":"-1.81","planned_cost_m":"2.505128","projectedactual_cost_m":"2.550497","updated_date":"27/04/2012","updated_time":"1899-12-31T14:16:19Z","unique_project_id":"G01A0102"},{"unique_investment_identifier":"021-271423723","business_case_id":"876","agency_code":"21","agency_name":"Department of Transportation","investment_title":"FAAXX800: NextGen R&D Trajectory Based Operations (TBO)","project_id":"616","agency_project_id":"G01A0103","project_name":"Separation Management - Automation Risk Mitigation","project_description":"This activity will support the assessment and risk mitigation activities for interfacing automation systems in support of the Advanced Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) applications.","start_date":"01/10/2010","completion_date_b1":"30/09/2012","planned_project_completion_date_b2":"30/09/2012","projectedactual_project_completion_date_b2":"30/09/2012","lifecycle_cost_m":"22.186346","schedule_variance_in_days":"0","schedule_variance":"0","cost_variance_m":"3.610594","cost_variance_check":"3.610594","check":"","cost_variance":"16.27","planned_cost_m":"22.186346","projectedactual_cost_m":"18.575752","updated_date":"25/01/2012","updated_time":"1899-12-31T14:44:02Z","unique_project_id":"G01A0103"},{"unique_investment_identifier":"021-271423723","business_case_id":"876","agency_code":"21","agency_name":"Department of Transportation","investment_title":"FAAXX800: NextGen R&D Trajectory Based Operations (TBO)","project_id":"617","agency_project_id":"G01A0202","project_name":"Trajectory Management - Oceanic Tactical Trajectory Management","project_description":"The Oceanic Tactical Trajectory Management program is a critical NextGen capability that addresses current performance gaps in the areas of capacity, productivity, efficiency, safety, and environmental impacts in the oceanic environment.

Conflict resolution advisories will first be implemented using voice and data in a mixed equipage environment, and ultimately will be transmitted solely via data in certain airspace. The implications for changing controller roles and responsibilities will be explored and the requirements for automation, decision support systems and data communications will be identified. High performance aircraft will directly connect via air-ground data communications to the flight management system, facilitating electronic data communications between the Air Traffic Control (ATC) automation and the flight deck automation. As a first step and in mixed performance airspace, the controller will still be responsible for aircraft separation by responding to problems predicted by the ATC automation. Instead of monitoring the sector airspace display to predict potential problems and mentally calculating problem resolutions, the automation will not only predict the problems but determine the best solution. The controller will transmit the solution via voice initially, and then via data link. This level of automation support helps manage controller workload as a means of safely dealing with the predicted increases in traffic volume. This activity will prototype earlier and easier resolutions capabilities (such as pre-probed altitude and speed amendments) that can be transferred verbally by controllers and evaluate the impact these have on the Computer Human Interface (CHI) design and system performance and conduct research into more complex issues for future implementation such as vector advisories as well as the role of the human versus automation in voice clearance, mixed voice and data communications environments, and data communications only.","start_date":"01/10/2010","completion_date_b1":"30/09/2012","planned_project_completion_date_b2":"30/09/2012","projectedactual_project_completion_date_b2":"30/09/2012","lifecycle_cost_m":"3.092484","schedule_variance_in_days":"0","schedule_variance":"0","cost_variance_m":"0.087176","cost_variance_check":"0.087176","check":"","cost_variance":"2.82","planned_cost_m":"3.092484","projectedactual_cost_m":"3.005308","updated_date":"27/04/2012","updated_time":"1899-12-31T14:16:19Z","unique_project_id":"G01A0203"},{"unique_investment_identifier":"021-271423723","business_case_id":"876","agency_code":"21","agency_name":"Department of Transportation","investment_title":"FAAXX800: NextGen R&D Trajectory Based Operations (TBO)","project_id":"619","agency_project_id":"G01N0101","project_name":"Capacity Management - NextGen Distance Measuring Equipment (DME)","project_description":"This program will provide near-term support for trajectory-based and performance-based operational requirements and will be functionally capable of providing the signal in space to fill the coverage gaps and meet the redundancy requirements for new Global Positioning System (GPS)/Area Navigation (RNAV)/Required Navigation Performance (RNP) procedures.

There are periods of low visibility when the aircraft cannot takeoff or land at their desired airport resulting in the following conditions: decreased numbers of arrivals/departures at high density airports; increased flight delays, cancellations, and/or diversions under IFR low visibility conditions; decreased capacity for airlines to schedule flights in marginal weather conditions (since both the primary and alternate routes must be approved within the flight plan); and decreased flexibility/potential congestion in the terminal environment. These problems can limit or prevent access to airports in IFR conditions, resulting in congestion and delay in the NAS.

On August 27, 2004, the President issued a Homeland Security Presidential Directive calling for a mandatory, government-wide standard for secure and reliable forms of identification issued by the federal government to its employees and federal contractors. The implementation of this Standard will ensure the identification for government employees and contractors is reliable and secure. The establishment of the PIV credential as part of a broader well managed enterprise solution enables common service capabilities in secure and reliable transactions. Further, it expedites SBAs ability to enable IT solutions that directly address line of business needs for disaster response, automated small business services such as electronic (and paperless) workflow services, and reduction in other existing investments for help desk operations and password management. E-Authentication falls within the scope of Identity and Access Management. This initiative expands e-Government by providing users access to online services that require authentication, using a solution that is secure as well as convenient and easy for customers, resulting in an improvement in the taxpayer experience. Through minimizing the burden on America's small businesses, the general public, and government partners, this initiative eliminates the need for separate processes for verification of identity and validation of electronic signatures. The IAM initiative provides a robust, highly secure, easy to manage centralized solution that automates the provisioning and deprovisioning of user identities mapped and managed to individual/entities, and manages each aspect of the identity lifecycle. By automating services, and doing so in accordance with well defined rules and role determination, SBA simplifies the independent management frameworks currently instituted individually by each application. As part of implementing security solutions at the individual application level, SBA addresses security risks on an individual basis, does not take advantage of economies of scale, and institutes varying levels of security, cost, and schedule risk across each program. This initiative will provide a security and operations focus on the management of common security services that are managed with industry proven solutions and solutions that adhere to well defined industry and federal standards.","start_date":"27/08/2010","completion_date_b1":"30/09/2011","planned_project_completion_date_b2":"30/09/2011","projectedactual_project_completion_date_b2":"30/12/2011","lifecycle_cost_m":"1.3","schedule_variance_in_days":"-91","schedule_variance":"-25","cost_variance_m":"0.1104","cost_variance_check":"0.1104","check":"","cost_variance":"8.99","planned_cost_m":"1.2286","projectedactual_cost_m":"1.1182","updated_date":"30/12/2011","updated_time":"1899-12-31T07:17:16Z","unique_project_id":"14655"},{"unique_investment_identifier":"028-000007007","business_case_id":"466","agency_code":"28","agency_name":"Small Business Administration","investment_title":"OCIO: Identity and Access Management and Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12)","project_id":"1402","agency_project_id":"30060","project_name":"PROJ: HSPD12 FY2012 DME","project_description":"Project activities will allow SBA to comply with OMB memo 11-11 which states that: All new systems under development must be enabled to use PIV credentials, in accordance with NIST guidelines, prior to being made operational.

NSF's financial management capabilities with a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) core financial management solution and interfaces in a shared services environment. iTRAK will replace NSF's existing Financial Accounting System (FAS), which is becoming technically and functionally outdated by growing mission-driven business demands and regulatory requirements. NSF needs to modernize its legacy financial accounting system (FAS), which is over 20 years old and is becoming technically and functionally outdated by growing mission-driven business demands and regulatory requirements. FAS cannot provide the robust financial management functionality needed in today's business environment and required by NSF to provide more accurate and reliable financial information for both external and internal stakeholders. iTRAK will provide NSF internal customers including financial staff, administrative staff, and Program managers, with improved funds management capability, reporting capabilities, and automated business processes. iTRAK will also strengthen internal controls by providing system edit checks and audit trails for all financial transactions. Through new functional capabilities and business process automation and standardization, iTRAK will help to improve NSF's operational excellence and enable efficient, effective execution of financial activities and business operations on behalf of NSF's external customers, science and education grantees. NSF Programs and grantees will also receive better, more timely financial information to manage their portfolios more effectively. An updated analysis of alternatives conducted in 2010 to comply with OMB Memo 10-26. Alt 2, 18-Month Approach, was selected as the superior alternative, resulting in the lowest risk-adjusted lifecycle cost, the highest NPV and ROI, and the highest value
